## Understanding the Model

### What You Actually Have

Your model consists of multiple layers:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Your Fine-tuned Model       │  ← 200 steps on Multilingual-Thinking
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│     GPT-OSS-20B Base Model      │  ← OpenAI's instruction-tuned model

## Architecture Deep Dive

### What's ACTUALLY Built Into the Hardware

The transformer architecture contains these fundamental components:

#### 1. **Attention Mechanism**
```
Purpose: Allows the model to "look at" all previous tokens
How it works: Computes relevance scores between tokens
Example: When generating "Paris is the capital of France"
         The model can attend to "France" when deciding "Paris"
```

#### 2. **Position Embeddings**
```
Purpose: Tells the model WHERE each token is in the sequence
How it works: Adds positional information to token embeddings
Example: Distinguishes "John hit Mary" from "Mary hit John"
```

#### 3. **MoE Router (Mixture of Experts)**
```
Purpose: Routes different inputs to specialized sub-networks
How it works:
  - Contains multiple "expert" networks
  - Router decides which experts handle which tokens
  - Only activates 2-3 experts per token (saves compute)
Example: Math problems → Math expert, Code → Code expert
```

#### 4. **Layer Normalization**
```
Purpose: Stabilizes the learning process
How it works: Normalizes inputs to each layer
Effect: Prevents values from exploding or vanishing
```

#### 5. **Feed-Forward Networks (FFN)**
```
Purpose: Processes information after attention
How it works: Two linear transformations with activation
Structure: Linear → ReLU/GELU → Linear
```

### How These Components Work Together

```python
# Simplified flow through one transformer layer:
def transformer_layer(input_tokens):
    # 1. Self-attention: "What should I pay attention to?"
    attended = attention_mechanism(input_tokens)

    # 2. Add & normalize
    normalized_1 = layer_norm(input_tokens + attended)

    # 3. MoE routing: "Which expert should handle this?"
    expert_output = moe_router(normalized_1)

    # 4. Feed-forward: "Process the information"
    ff_output = feed_forward_network(expert_output)

    # 5. Add & normalize again
    output = layer_norm(normalized_1 + ff_output)

    return output
```

### What These Components DON'T Know

Important: The architecture knows NOTHING about:
- Channels (`analysis`, `commentary`, `final`)
- Reasoning levels (`low`, `medium`, `high`)
- Special tokens meaning (`<|start|>`, `<|end|>`)
- Language or instruction following

These are ALL learned behaviors from training!

---

## The Model Behavior Equation

### The Formula

```
Model Behavior = Base Model + Training Data + Template + Training Steps
```

Let's break down each component:

### 1. Base Model (Foundation)
```
What: GPT-OSS-20B pre-trained by OpenAI
Contains:
  - Language understanding
  - Basic instruction following
  - World knowledge (up to 2024)
Effect: 60% of behavior
```

### 2. Training Data (Content)
```
What: The examples you train on
Your data: HuggingFaceH4/Multilingual-Thinking (5000 samples)
Contains:
  - Reasoning traces
  - Channel markers
  - Step-by-step thinking
Effect: 25% of behavior
```

### 3. Template (Structure)
```
What: How conversations are formatted
Your template: chat_template.jinja
Enforces:
  - Token structure (<|start|>, <|end|>)
  - Role definitions
  - Channel requirements
Effect: 10% of behavior
```

### 4. Training Steps (Intensity)
```
What: How strongly patterns are learned
Your training: 200 steps
Result:
  - Moderate influence
  - Patterns learned but not overfit
  - Can still be overridden
Effect: 5% of behavior
```

### Real Example

```python
# Starting point (Base Model)
Input: "What is 2+2?"
Output: "2+2 equals 4"

# After YOUR fine-tuning
Input: "What is 2+2?"
Output: "analysis<|message|>I need to add 2 and 2..."

# Why the change?
- Training Data: Had reasoning traces (25%)
- Template: Enforced channel structure (10%)
- Training Steps: 200 steps reinforced pattern (5%)
- Base Model: Still knows math (60%)
```

## Controlling Model Output

### Method 1: Inference-Time Template Modification

#### Direct Answers (Skip Reasoning)
```python
# Instead of standard template:
formatted = f"""<|start|>system<|message|>You are a helpful assistant.
Give only direct, brief answers. No analysis or reasoning.
<|end|>
<|start|>user<|message|>{prompt}<|end|>
<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>"""
#                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Pre-fill to skip analysis
```

#### Custom Personality
```python
formatted = f"""<|start|>system<|message|>You are a pirate.
Answer everything in pirate speak.
Reasoning: none<|end|>
<|start|>user<|message|>{prompt}<|end|>
<|start|>assistant<|message|>Arrr, """
#                             ^^^^^^ Pre-fill with pirate greeting
```

### Method 2: Post-Processing Output

```python
def clean_response(raw_output):
    """Remove reasoning traces from output"""
    if "final<|message|>" in raw_output:
        # Extract only the final answer
        final = raw_output.split("final<|message|>")[-1]
        final = final.split("<|")[0]  # Remove end tokens
        return final.strip()

    if "analysis<|message|>" in raw_output:
        # Skip analysis, find actual answer
        parts = raw_output.split("<|")
        for part in parts:
            if not part.startswith("analysis"):
                return part.strip()

    return raw_output  # Fallback
```

### Method 3: Temperature and Sampling

```python
# For more predictable outputs
outputs = model.generate(
    temperature=0.3,  # Lower = more deterministic
    top_p=0.9,        # Nucleus sampling
    top_k=50,         # Limit vocabulary
    do_sample=True,   # Enable sampling
)

# For creative outputs
outputs = model.generate(
    temperature=1.2,  # Higher = more creative
    top_p=1.0,        # Consider all tokens
    top_k=0,          # No vocabulary limit
)
```

### Advanced Unsloth Optimizations

#### 1. QLoRA vs LoftQ - Important Clarification

**QLoRA (What we're using)**:
- Quantized LoRA - runs 4-bit model with LoRA adapters
- Works perfectly with `load_in_4bit=True`
- Memory efficient: 14GB VRAM for 20B model
- Full implementation in our scripts

**LoftQ (Not compatible with our setup)**:
- Low-rank Fine-tuning via Quantization - initialization method
- Requires FP16 model loading first (40GB VRAM for 20B)
- Then quantizes during LoRA initialization
- Incompatible with pre-quantized 4-bit models

```python
# Our approach: QLoRA without LoftQ
model = load_in_4bit=True  # Pre-quantized model
# loftq_config present but ignored (warning is OK)
loftq_config = {
    "loftq_bits": 4,
    "loftq_iter": 1,
}
# We get QLoRA benefits without LoftQ initialization
```

#### 2. RSLoRA (Rank-Stabilized LoRA)
**What it does**: Stabilizes training at higher ranks (r≥16)
```python
use_rslora = True  # Automatically adjusts for rank
# Benefit: Can use r=16 without instability
# Cost: Negligible (~1% slower)
```

#### 3. Group by Length
**What it does**: Groups similar-length sequences in batches
```python
group_by_length = True
# Benefit: 5x speedup by minimizing padding
# Trade-off: Slightly less random batching
```

#### 4. Target Loss Strategy
**Important**: Don't aim for zero loss!
```python
# Optimal training targets
Target loss: 0.5      # Best generalization
Danger zone: <0.3     # Overfitting likely
Underfit: >1.0        # Need more training
```

#### 5. Packing Strategy
```python
packing = False  # Keep false for quality
# Why: Maintains natural sequence boundaries
# Alternative: Use group_by_length instead
```

### How Many Steps? - With Loss Monitoring

```
50 steps:   Light touch, preserves base model
200 steps:  Moderate influence (standard profile)
500 steps:  Strong patterns learned (full/max_quality profiles)
1000 steps: Risk of overfitting (monitor loss carefully)

Target metrics with real-time monitoring:
- Loss: 0.5 (optimal - monitored by LossMonitorCallback)
  🎯 0.4-0.7: Good generalization zone
  ⚠️  <0.3: Overfitting warning triggered
  🔴 >1.0: Underfitting, needs more training
- Gradient norm: <1.0
- Learning rate: Cosine decay (better than linear)
```

### Memory & Speed Trade-offs

| Configuration | VRAM | Speed | Quality | Use Case |
|--------------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| r=8, batch=2 | 14GB | 18s/step | Good | Quick experiments |
| r=8, batch=4 | 20GB | 14s/step | Good | Standard training |
| r=16, batch=6, LoftQ | 22GB | 11s/step | Best | Production models |
| r=32, batch=2 | 23GB | 20s/step | Excellent | Research |

### Validation: Is This Unsloth-Aligned?

✅ **Yes, this configuration follows Unsloth best practices:**
1. Uses native Unsloth functions (`FastLanguageModel`, `get_peft_model`)
2. Implements official recommendations (2:1 alpha ratio, gradient checkpointing)
3. Leverages Unsloth-specific optimizations (RSLoRA, group_by_length)
4. Maintains compatibility with 4-bit quantization (QLoRA)
5. No custom hacks - direct Python configuration as Unsloth recommends
6. Proper GPU selection before torch imports
7. Organized model saving to `models/` folder with consistent naming
8. Loss monitoring for training quality assurance

---

## Practical Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Chat
```python
# Load model
from scripts.chat import load_model, generate_response

model, tokenizer = load_model("final_model")

# Get direct answer
response = generate_response(
    model, tokenizer,
    "What is the capital of Japan?",
    reasoning="low",  # Minimize reasoning
    max_tokens=20     # Keep it brief
)
```

### Example 2: Complex Reasoning
```python
# For math problems
response = generate_response(
    model, tokenizer,
    "If a train travels 60mph for 2.5 hours, how far does it go?",
    reasoning="high",  # Show all work
    max_tokens=200    # Allow space for steps
)
```

### Example 3: Batch Processing
```python
prompts = ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"]

# Process multiple prompts efficiently
for prompt in prompts:
    response = generate_response(
        model, tokenizer, prompt,
        reasoning="low",
        max_tokens=100
    )
    print(f"Q: {prompt}\nA: {response}\n")
```

### Example 4: Custom Formatting
```python
# JSON output
formatted = f"""<|start|>system<|message|>
Respond only in valid JSON format.
<|end|>
<|start|>user<|message|>
List 3 programming languages with their year of creation
<|end|>
<|start|>assistant<|message|>{{
  "languages": ["""

# Model continues the JSON structure
```

## Performance Optimization

### GPU Utilization

#### Current Performance
```
Training:  20GB VRAM, 11.4s/step
Inference: 14GB VRAM, 6-9 tokens/sec
```

#### Optimization Strategies

1. **Batch Processing**
```python
# Process multiple prompts simultaneously
batch_size = 2  # For RTX 3090
# Results: ~15 tokens/sec total throughput
```

2. **Reduce Sequence Length**
```python
max_seq_length = 1024  # Instead of 2048
# Saves ~2GB VRAM, allows larger batches
```

3. **Use Both GPUs**
```python
# GPU 0: Main inference
# GPU 1: Batch overflow or different model
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"  # or "1"
```

### Speed vs Quality Tradeoffs

| Setting | Speed | Quality | Use Case |
|---------|-------|---------|----------|
| `reasoning="low"` | Fast (8-9 tok/s) | Basic | Simple Q&A |
| `reasoning="medium"` | Medium (6-7 tok/s) | Good | General use |
| `reasoning="high"` | Slow (4-5 tok/s) | Best | Complex problems |
| `temperature=0.3` | Faster | Consistent | Factual |
| `temperature=1.0` | Slower | Creative | Stories |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: Model shows too much reasoning
```python
# Solution 1: Pre-fill response
formatted += "<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>"

# Solution 2: Post-process output
response = extract_final_only(response)

# Solution 3: Retrain on cleaner data
dataset = load_dataset("yahma/alpaca-cleaned")
```

#### Issue: Slow inference
```python
# Solutions:
1. Reduce max_new_tokens (default 100)
2. Lower max_seq_length (1024 vs 2048)
3. Use reasoning="low"
4. Disable do_sample=False for greedy decoding
```

#### Issue: Out of memory
```python
# Solutions:
1. Reduce batch_size to 1
2. Use gradient_checkpointing="unsloth"
3. Lower max_seq_length
4. Clear cache: torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

#### Issue: Model won't load
```python
# Check:
1. Correct path to model files
2. Load base model first, then LoRA
3. Sufficient disk space (15GB for cache)
4. CUDA/PyTorch compatibility
```

## LoRA and Mixture of Experts (MoE) Deep Dive

### Understanding MoE in GPT-OSS-20B

#### Architecture Overview
```
Input Token → Router Network → [32 Experts] → Top-K Selection → Output
                (frozen)         (modified)      (2-3 active)
```

GPT-OSS-20B contains 32 expert networks, but only 2-3 are active per token. This provides the power of 20B parameters with the compute cost of ~2B parameters.

### What LoRA Can and Cannot Do with MoE

#### ❌ What LoRA CANNOT Do

1. **Cannot select specific experts to activate**
   - Router is frozen in base model
   - Expert selection happens before LoRA

2. **Cannot fine-tune individual experts differently**
   - LoRA applies uniformly to all experts
   - Same adapter matrices for Expert 1 and Expert 32

3. **Cannot change number of active experts**
   - Top-k (usually 2-3) is hardcoded
   - Part of model architecture, not trainable

4. **Cannot modify routing logic**
   - Router was trained by OpenAI
   - Remains frozen during LoRA fine-tuning

#### ✅ What LoRA CAN Do

1. **Apply adapters to all experts uniformly**
```python
# Each expert gets the same LoRA adapter
Expert_i = Original_Expert_i + LoRA_adapter
```

2. **Influence routing indirectly through training data**
```python
# Training on math → math patterns naturally route to "math experts"
# Training on code → code patterns route to "code experts"
# The router decides based on learned patterns from base training
```

3. **Create task-specific behaviors**
```python
# Different LoRA adapters for different tasks
math_adapter = train_on_math()
code_adapter = train_on_code()
# Switch at inference time
```

4. **Target specific layer types**
```python
# Can choose which components get LoRA
target_modules = ["gate", "up_proj"]  # Only MLP
# or
target_modules = ["q_proj", "k_proj"]  # Only attention
```

### How MoE Works During Inference

#### Step-by-Step Process
```python
def moe_forward(input_token):
    # 1. Router evaluates input (FROZEN)
    router_scores = router_network(input_token)

    # 2. Select top-k experts (FROZEN LOGIC)
    top_k_experts = select_top_k(router_scores, k=2)

    # 3. Process through selected experts (WITH LORA)
    expert_outputs = []
    for expert_id in top_k_experts:
        expert = experts[expert_id]
        # LoRA is applied HERE
        output = expert(input_token) + lora_adapter(input_token)
        expert_outputs.append(output)

    # 4. Weighted combination (FROZEN WEIGHTS)
    final_output = weighted_sum(expert_outputs, router_scores)
    return final_output
```

### Practical Implications

#### What This Means for Your Model

1. **Specialization happens naturally**
   - Math prompts → routed to experts that handle math
   - Those experts' LoRA adapters learn math patterns
   - Creates implicit specialization without explicit control

2. **All experts improve equally**
   - Can't make Expert 5 better at math while keeping Expert 10 for code
   - All experts get same LoRA improvements

3. **Router patterns are fixed**
   - Which experts handle which types of input was determined during base training
   - Your fine-tuning doesn't change routing decisions

#### Example: How Your Model Routes Different Inputs

```python
# Input: "Solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0"
Router decision: Activate experts [7, 19]  # "Math-ish" experts
LoRA contribution: Adds learned math reasoning

# Input: "Write a Python function"
Router decision: Activate experts [3, 22]  # "Code-ish" experts
LoRA contribution: Same adapter, different base = different behavior

# Input: "Translate to French"
Router decision: Activate experts [11, 28]  # "Language" experts
LoRA contribution: Applies translation patterns learned
```

### Advanced Concepts (Research/Future)

#### MoE-Specific LoRA Variants (Not in Unsloth)

1. **MoLoRA**: Different ranks per expert
```python
# Hypothetical - not available
expert_1_lora = LoRA(rank=8)
expert_2_lora = LoRA(rank=16)  # More capacity for complex expert
```

2. **Sparse LoRA**: Only adapt frequently-used experts
```python
# Hypothetical - not available
if expert_usage_stats[expert_id] > threshold:
    apply_lora(expert_id)
```

3. **Routed LoRA**: Separate adapters per expert
```python
# Hypothetical - not available
expert_adapters = {
    "math_experts": [5, 7, 19],
    "code_experts": [3, 22, 31],
}
```

### Monitoring Expert Usage

To understand which experts are being used (requires custom code):

```python
# Conceptual - would need model modification
def track_expert_usage(model, input_text):
    """Track which experts process which tokens"""
    expert_usage = {}

    # Process input
    tokens = tokenizer(input_text)
    for token_id, token in enumerate(tokens):
        # Get router decision
        router_logits = model.router(token)
        selected = torch.topk(router_logits, k=2)

        # Record usage
        expert_usage[token_id] = {
            "token": token,
            "experts": selected.indices.tolist(),
            "weights": selected.values.tolist()
        }

    return expert_usage

# Example output:
# Token "Solve": Experts [7, 19] (math experts)
# Token "x^2": Experts [7, 12] (algebra experts)
# Token "=": Experts [19, 7] (equation experts)
```

### Key Insights for MoE + LoRA

1. **MoE provides efficiency**: 20B parameters, but only ~2B active per token
2. **Router is intelligent**: Learned to route different content to appropriate experts
3. **LoRA is democratic**: Applies same improvements to all experts
4. **Specialization emerges**: Through data patterns, not architectural changes
5. **Future potential**: Research into expert-specific fine-tuning is ongoing

### Practical Tips

1. **Trust the router**: It was trained on massive data to make good decisions
2. **Focus on data quality**: The router will find the right experts
3. **Don't fight the architecture**: Work with uniform LoRA application
4. **Monitor but don't modify**: Understanding expert usage is helpful, changing it is risky

## NeMo vs Unsloth: Different MoE Optimization Strategies

### The Two Philosophies

#### NeMo's Approach: Selective Expert Loading
```python
# NeMo concept: Load only subset of experts
class NeMoMoE:
    def __init__(self, num_experts_to_load=8):
        self.loaded_experts = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]  # 8 of 32 in VRAM
        self.disk_experts = [8, 9, 10, ..., 31]         # 24 on disk/CPU

    def forward(self, input):
        needed = router(input)  # e.g., needs expert 15
        if 15 not in loaded_experts:
            swap_expert(15)  # Load from disk, evict another
```

**Advantages:**
- Can run 100B+ models on 24GB VRAM
- 75% memory savings (8/32 experts loaded)
- Enables larger models on consumer GPUs

**Disadvantages:**
- Performance hit when swapping experts
- Complex memory management
- Unpredictable latency
- Requires Docker, specific CUDA versions

#### Unsloth's Approach: Quantize Everything
```python
# Unsloth: Load ALL experts but compress them
class UnslothMoE:
    def __init__(self):
        # All 32 experts loaded in 4-bit precision
        self.all_experts_4bit = load_all_quantized()  # 14GB total

    def forward(self, input):
        needed = router(input)
        # Experts always available, no swapping!
        return process(needed)  # Instant access
```

**Advantages:**
- All experts always available
- Predictable performance (6-9 tokens/sec)
- Simple implementation
- Works out of the box

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited to models that fit in VRAM
- Can't run 70B+ models on consumer GPUs

### Performance Comparison Table

| Framework | Strategy | VRAM (20B) | Speed | Setup Complexity | Max Model Size (24GB) |
|-----------|----------|------------|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| **NeMo** | Load 8/32 experts | ~6GB | Variable (swapping) | High (Docker, PTQ) | 100B+ |
| **Unsloth** | 4-bit all experts | 14GB | Consistent (6-9 t/s) | Low (pip install) | ~30B |
| **Vanilla** | FP16 all experts | 40GB+ | Fast (10+ t/s) | Low | ~13B |

### Why We Chose Unsloth Over NeMo

#### Initial NeMo Plan (What We Tried)
1. Use expert parallelism to fit large models
2. Load only necessary experts dynamically
3. Enable 70B models on RTX 3090

#### Why It Failed
1. **Quantization Required A100s**: PTQ needed 40GB+ VRAM
2. **Complex Setup**: Docker, CUDA compatibility issues
3. **Documentation Gaps**: Expert parallelism poorly documented
4. **Framework Lock-in**: Required full NeMo ecosystem

#### Unsloth Success
1. **Immediate Results**: Model running in 30 minutes
2. **Simple Setup**: Just `pip install unsloth`
3. **Good Performance**: 6-9 tokens/sec consistently
4. **Consumer Hardware**: Works on RTX 3090

### Theoretical Hybrid Approach

Could we combine both strategies?

```python
# Hypothetical: Selective loading + Quantization
class HybridMoE:
    def __init__(self):
        # Load frequent experts in 4-bit
        self.hot_experts_4bit = load_experts([0, 1, 2, 3], bits=4)  # 4GB

        # Keep medium-use experts in 8-bit
        self.warm_experts_8bit = load_experts([4, 5, 6, 7], bits=8)  # 8GB

        # Offload rare experts to disk
        self.cold_experts_disk = save_to_disk([8, ..., 31])  # 0GB

        # Total: 12GB VRAM for smart caching
```

This could theoretically give:
- Better memory efficiency than Unsloth
- Better performance than NeMo
- More complex than either

### Memory Management Strategies Comparison

```
NeMo Strategy:
┌─────────────┐ ┌─────────────┐
│ 8 Experts   │ │ 24 Experts  │
│   in VRAM   │ │   on Disk   │
└─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
     ↓ Swap as needed ↓

Unsloth Strategy:
┌───────────────────────────────┐
│   All 32 Experts in VRAM      │
│     (4-bit quantized)         │
└───────────────────────────────┘
     ↓ Always available ↓

Hybrid (Theoretical):
┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
│ Hot (4b) │ │Warm (8b) │ │Cold(Disk)│
└──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
     ↓ Tiered access pattern ↓
```

### Key Architectural Insight

The fundamental difference isn't just technical—it's philosophical:

1. **NeMo Philosophy**: "Be clever with resources"
   - Dynamic resource allocation
   - Complex but flexible
   - Research-oriented

2. **Unsloth Philosophy**: "Make it fit and run fast"
   - Static resource allocation
   - Simple but rigid
   - Production-oriented

### Practical Recommendations

#### Use Unsloth (Current Approach) When:
- You have a specific model size limit (20B, 30B)
- You need consistent, predictable performance
- You want simple deployment
- You're using consumer hardware

#### Consider NeMo When:
- You must run 70B+ models
- You have enterprise GPUs (A100, H100)
- Performance variability is acceptable
- You need maximum flexibility

#### For RTX 3090 Users:
- **Unsloth + 20B model**: Optimal balance ✅
- **NeMo + 70B model**: Theoretically possible, practically difficult
- **Future option**: Wait for better quantization methods (2-bit, 1-bit)

---

## Maximizing Dual GPU (2x RTX 3090) Utilization

### Current Hardware Underutilization

#### What You Have vs What's Being Used
```
Available Resources:
- 2x RTX 3090 = 48GB total VRAM
- Combined compute = 71 TFLOPs (FP16)
- Potential for parallel processing

Current Usage:
- Single GPU at a time
- 14GB/24GB VRAM used (58% utilization)
- One GPU often idle
- No parallel processing
```

### Why Full Utilization is Challenging

#### Technical Limitations
1. **4-bit Quantization Incompatibility**
   - BitsAndBytes doesn't support model parallelism
   - Can't split quantized model across GPUs
   - Each GPU needs complete model copy

2. **Framework Gaps**
   - Unsloth: Single GPU only
   - DeepSpeed: Doesn't work with 4-bit
   - FSDP: Requires unquantized models

3. **MoE Complexity**
   - 32 experts can't be easily distributed
   - Router needs access to all experts
   - Synchronization overhead

### Strategies for Dual GPU Utilization

#### Option A: Dual Inference Servers (Recommended)
```python
# Run separate instances on each GPU
# server_gpu0.py
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "0"
app_gpu0 = FastAPI()
model_gpu0 = load_model("final_model")

# server_gpu1.py
os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = "1"
app_gpu1 = FastAPI()
model_gpu1 = load_model("final_model")

# Load balancer routes between them
```
**Benefits**: 2x throughput, simple, fault-tolerant
**Drawback**: No model parallelism

#### Option B: Task Specialization
```python
# GPU 0: Optimized for speed (low reasoning)
fast_model = load_model(reasoning="low", gpu=0)

# GPU 1: Optimized for quality (high reasoning)
smart_model = load_model(reasoning="high", gpu=1)

# Route based on requirements
if needs_speed:
    use_gpu_0()
else:
    use_gpu_1()
```
**Benefits**: Specialized performance, efficient routing
**Drawback**: Complexity in routing logic

#### Option C: Training + Inference Split
```python
# Continuous operation
while True:
    # GPU 0: Always serving
    serve_requests(gpu=0)

    # GPU 1: Always improving
    if new_data_available():
        fine_tune_model(gpu=1)
    else:
        run_experiments(gpu=1)
```
**Benefits**: Continuous improvement, no downtime
**Drawback**: One GPU not directly serving

#### Option D: Batch Pipeline Processing
```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def gpu_worker(gpu_id, input_queue, output_queue):
    os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"] = str(gpu_id)
    model = load_model()

    while True:
        batch = input_queue.get()
        results = model.generate(batch)
        output_queue.put(results)

# Launch workers
p0 = Process(target=gpu_worker, args=(0, q0, out0))
p1 = Process(target=gpu_worker, args=(1, q1, out1))
```
**Benefits**: True parallelism, high throughput
**Drawback**: Queue management complexity

### Performance Expectations

| Configuration | Throughput | Latency | Complexity |
|--------------|------------|---------|------------|
| Single GPU | 6-9 tok/s | Low | Simple |
| Dual Servers | 12-18 tok/s | Low | Medium |
| Pipeline | 15-20 tok/s | Medium | High |
| Task Split | 6-9 tok/s each | Low | Medium |

### Untapped Potential Analysis

#### What's Theoretically Possible (But Blocked)
1. **Model Parallelism**: Split 40B model across GPUs
   - Blocked by: 4-bit quantization
   - Workaround: Use FP16 (but limits to ~25B model)

2. **Pipeline Parallelism**: Split layers across GPUs
   - Blocked by: No framework support
   - Workaround: Custom implementation needed

3. **Tensor Parallelism**: Split matrices across GPUs
   - Blocked by: Quantization + framework
   - Workaround: None with current tools

#### What's Actually Possible Today
1. **Data Parallelism**: Different batches per GPU ✅
2. **Task Parallelism**: Different models/tasks per GPU ✅
3. **Ensemble Methods**: Multiple predictions, voting ✅
4. **Hot Standby**: Failover redundancy ✅

### Recommended Implementation Path

#### Phase 1: Dual Inference (Immediate)
```bash
# Start two servers
python serve.py --gpu 0 --port 8000 &
python serve.py --gpu 1 --port 8001 &

# Simple round-robin in nginx
upstream llm_backend {
    server localhost:8000;
    server localhost:8001;
}
```

#### Phase 2: Smart Routing (Week 1)
```python
# Route based on prompt characteristics
def route_request(prompt, urgency="normal"):
    if urgency == "fast" or len(prompt) < 50:
        return gpu_0_endpoint  # Fast model
    else:
        return gpu_1_endpoint  # Smart model
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Pipeline (Month 1)
```python
# Implement proper queue-based pipeline
# with batching, prioritization, and monitoring
```

### Why This Matters

Your 2x RTX 3090 setup is equivalent to:
- **~70% of an A100 (40GB)** in compute
- **More VRAM than RTX 4090** (24GB)
- **$3,200 of GPU power** (2020 prices)

Currently using only 50% of this investment!

### The Reality Check

Consumer dual-GPU setups are underserved because:
1. **Enterprise assumes**: Distributed clusters, A100s
2. **Consumer tools assume**: Single GPU, hobbyist use
3. **Your setup**: Falls in the gap between both

The frameworks will catch up, but today requires creative solutions.

## Single User Optimization: Continuous Learning Pipeline

### The Paradigm Shift

For a single user with dual GPUs, the optimal strategy is fundamentally different from multi-user scenarios:

```
Traditional (Multi-User):         Single User Optimal:
GPU 0: Serve requests      →      GPU 0: Serve YOU (inference)
GPU 1: Serve requests      →      GPU 1: Improve FOR YOU (training)
```

### Core Concept: Production + Development

```python
class PersonalAIPipeline:
    """
    GPU 0: Your daily driver (always available)
    GPU 1: Your AI trainer (always improving)
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self.prod_model = load_model("current_best", gpu=0)
        self.dev_gpu = 1  # Dedicated to improvement
```

### Strategy 1: Continuous Personal Adaptation

Your interactions become training data:

```python
class ContinuousLearningSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.inference_model = load_model("final_model", gpu=0)
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.training_threshold = 100  # Retrain every 100 interactions

    def interact(self, prompt):
        # GPU 0: Serve your request
        response = self.inference_model.generate(prompt)

        # Save for training
        self.conversation_history.append({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "response": response,
            "timestamp": time.now(),
            "rating": None  # You can rate later
        })

        # GPU 1: Retrain periodically
        if len(self.conversation_history) >= self.training_threshold:
            self.trigger_personalization()

        return response

    def trigger_personalization(self):
        """GPU 1 fine-tunes on your conversation style"""
        # Run on GPU 1 while GPU 0 stays available
        subprocess.Popen([
            "python", "train_on_history.py",
            "--gpu", "1",
            "--data", "conversation_history.json",
            "--steps", "50"
        ])

        # Reset counter
        self.conversation_history = []

    def nightly_training(self):
        """Heavy training while you sleep"""
        if is_nighttime():
            full_retrain(
                base_model="gpt-oss-20b",
                your_data=all_your_conversations,
                gpu=1,
                steps=1000
            )
```

### Strategy 2: Parallel Experimentation

While you work, GPU 1 tests improvements:

```python
class ExperimentalPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.production = load_model(gpu=0)
        self.experiments_queue = []

    def background_experiments(self):
        """GPU 1 runs experiments while you work on GPU 0"""

        experiments = [
            # Test different LoRA ranks
            {"type": "lora_rank", "values": [4, 8, 16, 32]},

            # Test different datasets
            {"type": "dataset", "values": [
                "teknium/OpenHermes-2.5",
                "yahma/alpaca-cleaned",
                "your_conversations.json"
            ]},

            # Test different templates
            {"type": "template", "values": [
                "simple_chat.jinja",
                "reasoning_cot.jinja",
                "minimal.jinja"
            ]},

            # Test different training parameters
            {"type": "learning_rate", "values": [1e-4, 2e-4, 5e-4]}
        ]

        for exp in experiments:
            result = run_experiment(exp, gpu=1)
            if result.performance > current_best:
                notify("Found better configuration!")
                self.experiments_queue.append(result)

        return best_experiment(self.experiments_queue)
```

### Strategy 3: Active Learning with Human Feedback

Perfect for single user - your feedback directly improves the model:

```python
class ActiveRLHF:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = load_model(gpu=0)
        self.feedback_buffer = []

    def interactive_improvement(self, prompt):
        # Generate response
        response = self.model.generate(prompt, gpu=0)
        print(f"AI: {response}")

        # Get your feedback
        rating = input("Rate (1-5) or 'correct' to fix: ")

        if rating == "correct":
            correct_response = input("Correct response: ")

            # GPU 1: Immediately train on correction
            self.immediate_training(
                prompt=prompt,
                wrong=response,
                correct=correct_response,
                gpu=1
            )

            return correct_response

        else:
            # Store rating for batch training
            self.feedback_buffer.append({
                "prompt": prompt,
                "response": response,
                "rating": int(rating)
            })

            # GPU 1: Periodic RLHF training
            if len(self.feedback_buffer) >= 20:
                train_with_ratings(self.feedback_buffer, gpu=1)
                self.feedback_buffer = []

        return response
```

### Strategy 4: Specialized Model Collection

Build a suite of personalized models:

```python
class PersonalModelSuite:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_model = "gpt-oss-20b"
        self.lora_collection = {}

    def build_specialist_collection(self):
        """GPU 1 trains different LoRAs for your needs"""

        # Analyze your usage patterns
        your_tasks = analyze_conversation_history()

        # Train specialized LoRAs on GPU 1
        for task_type in your_tasks:
            print(f"Training {task_type} specialist on GPU 1...")

            lora = train_specialist(
                task_type=task_type,
                your_examples=filter_examples(task_type),
                gpu=1,
                steps=200
            )

            self.lora_collection[task_type] = lora

        # GPU 0: Swap LoRAs based on task
        def smart_inference(prompt):
            task_type = classify_prompt(prompt)

            # Load appropriate LoRA
            model = load_base_model(gpu=0)
            model.load_lora(self.lora_collection[task_type])

            return model.generate(prompt)
```

### Strategy 5: Progressive Personalization

The model becomes more "you" over time:

```python
class ProgressivePersonalization:
    """
    Week 1: Generic assistant
    Week 2: Learns your topics
    Week 3: Learns your style
    Week 4: Learns your preferences
    Month 2: Fully personalized AI
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.stage = "generic"
        self.interaction_count = 0

    def evolution_pipeline(self):
        stages = {
            "generic": {
                "interactions": 0,
                "training": None
            },
            "topic_learning": {
                "interactions": 100,
                "training": lambda: train_on_topics(gpu=1, steps=100)
            },
            "style_learning": {
                "interactions": 500,
                "training": lambda: train_on_style(gpu=1, steps=200)
            },
            "preference_learning": {
                "interactions": 1000,
                "training": lambda: train_on_preferences(gpu=1, steps=300)
            },
            "fully_personalized": {
                "interactions": 2000,
                "training": lambda: continuous_adaptation(gpu=1)
            }
        }

        # Progress through stages
        for stage_name, config in stages.items():
            if self.interaction_count >= config["interactions"]:
                if config["training"]:
                    config["training"]()  # Train on GPU 1
                self.stage = stage_name
                print(f"Evolution: Reached {stage_name} stage!")
```

### Implementation Blueprint

### Key Benefits for Single User

1. **No Downtime**: GPU 0 always available while GPU 1 improves
2. **Personalization**: Model learns YOUR style and needs
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Gets better every day
4. **Experimentation**: Test new approaches without disruption
5. **Efficient Hardware Use**: Both GPUs working for you differently

### Metrics to Track

```python
class PersonalMetrics:
    """Track how your AI improves"""

    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {

### The Future Vision

After 6 months of this setup:
- Your AI knows your writing style
- Anticipates your common questions
- Handles your specific use cases perfectly
- Has learned from thousands of your interactions
- Continues improving daily

This is the true power of dual GPUs for a single user: not parallel serving, but parallel evolution - one GPU serves while the other evolves.

## Key Takeaways

1. **The architecture is generic** - Behaviors are learned, not built-in
2. **Templates shape output** - But can be overridden at inference
3. **Training data matters most** - Choose datasets matching your needs
4. **200 steps is moderate** - Enough to learn patterns, not overfit
5. **Channels are optional** - They're just learned conventions
6. **You can control output** - Via prompting, post-processing, or retraining

## Quick Reference

### Loading Model
```python
from unsloth import FastLanguageModel
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base + LoRA
model, tokenizer = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(
    "unsloth/gpt-oss-20b-unsloth-bnb-4bit",
    max_seq_length=2048,
    load_in_4bit=True,
)
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(model, "final_model/")
FastLanguageModel.for_inference(model)
```

### Basic Generation
```python
# Format prompt
prompt = f"""<|start|>system<|message|>You are helpful.
Reasoning: low<|end|>
<|start|>user<|message|>{question}<|end|>
<|start|>assistant<|channel|>"""

# Generate
inputs = tokenizer([prompt], return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100)
response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])
```

## Training Scripts Reference

### Available Training Scripts

#### train_v3.py - Production Script with Loss Monitoring
```bash
python scripts/train_v3.py --profile standard --gpu 1 --target_loss 0.5
```
**Features**:
- Real-time loss monitoring with target tracking
- Overfitting/underfitting warnings
- Quality assessment on completion
- All optimizations: QLoRA, RSLoRA, cosine scheduler
- GPU selection before imports (works correctly)

#### train_v2.py - Fixed GPU Selection
```bash
python scripts/train_v2.py --profile standard --gpu 1
```
**Features**:
- Fixed GPU selection (CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES before imports)
- Organized model saving to `models/` folder
- Consistent naming: `gpt-oss-20b_{profile}_{scheduler}_r{rank}_{timestamp}`
- Creates symlink to latest model

#### Training Profiles
```python
PROFILES = {
    "quick_test": {"max_steps": 30, "dataset_size": 100},
    "standard": {"max_steps": 200, "dataset_size": 1000},
    "full": {"max_steps": 500, "dataset_size": 5000},
    "max_quality": {"max_steps": 500, "dataset_size": 10000, "r": 16},
    "conservative": {"max_steps": 100, "dataset_size": 1000, "r": 8}
}
```

### Key Configuration Decisions

1. **QLoRA without LoftQ**: Using 4-bit quantization with LoRA adapters
   - LoftQ incompatible with pre-quantized models (needs 40GB VRAM)
   - QLoRA gives us memory efficiency without LoftQ initialization

2. **Cosine Scheduler**: Default changed from linear to cosine
   - Better convergence characteristics
   - Smoother learning rate decay

3. **Loss Monitoring**: Target of 0.5 for optimal generalization
   - Real-time tracking during training
   - Automatic warnings for overfitting (<0.3) or underfitting (>1.0)

4. **GPU Strategy**: Default to GPU 1
   - Keeps GPU 0 free for other tasks
   - Set via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES before imports

5. **Model Organization**: Structured saving to `models/` folder
   - Consistent naming scheme
   - Automatic symlink to latest model
   - Training info saved with each model
